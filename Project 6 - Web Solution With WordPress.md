# PROJECT 6: WEB SOLUTION WITH WORDPRESS
PHP is currently the dominant web programming language used by more websites than any other programming language. In this project, I will prepare storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implement a basic web solution using WordPress, a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with MySQL or MariaDB as its backend Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
Thre are two parts to this project:
  1. Configuring storage subsystem for Web and Database servers based on Linux OS.
  2. Installing WordPress and connecting it to a remote MySQL database server.
